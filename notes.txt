docker inspect fcc97e066cc8 | grep IPAddress

In the pgadmin service, a hostname alias pgsql-server to the db container is created.

Next, when you specify ./Frontend/ :/var/www/html/, you are specifying a bind mount 
which is why when you look in ./Frontend on the host-side, all of the files you expect 
to see are gone. If I understand your end-goal correctly, you want to have the files in 
/var/www/html/ within the container be accessible via the exact same location outside 
of the container. If so, then you probably want to use a named volume along with a 
user-specified mount point as follows:

depends_on expresses startup and shutdown dependencies between services.
